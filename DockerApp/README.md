<b>This is my first attempt to DOCKER system </b>

First attempt with DOCKER. I don't know what the final shape will be yet. 
I'm leaning towards making it something like an interactive diary/blog with the ability to add photos.

However, the whole mechanics of DOCKER are fully functional.


The project is based on this tutorial:
